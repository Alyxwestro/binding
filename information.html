                        This website is a collection of three texts by Michael Rock, Cortney Cassidy, Andrew Blauvelt, Daniel Eatock, and Dave Eggers.
                        Rock advocates for recognizing the complexity of design elements like typography, form, and color, emphasizing their role in storytelling. 
                        What resonates most with me is "Viewing your work as a continuous development of ideas over multiple projects."
                        Second, Cassidy delves into the subjective nature of color perception, highlighting how individual experiences and contexts shape our understanding of color. 
                        The third article argues that designers need critical design alternatives to balance collaboration and break design patterns in design thinking.

                        I curated this website as Design Epoch, meaning the period of how I process design thinking based on these three articles.
                        My direction is to give the website a tension of complexity and simplicity via layouts, letter spacing and colors, maintaining consistency under one roof. 
                        Through this, I also wanted to provide a place for a new, fun experience for the user to widen their subjective interpretations while browsing the website. 
                        When you work on (read on) something, and different storytelling comes, it will be an opportunity for creativity.
