             <h1>Fuck Content</h1>
             <h4>Michael Rock / 2009</h4>
             <p>
                In Designer as Author I argued that we are insecure about the value of our work.
                We are envious of the power, social position and cachet that artists and authors seem to command. 
                By declaring ourselves “designer/authors” we hope to garner similar respect. 
                Our deep-seated anxiety has motivated a movement in design that values origination of content over manipulation of content.
             </p>
             <p>
                Designer as Author was an attempt to recuperate the act of design itself as essentially linguistic—a vibrant, evocative language.
                However, it has often been read as a call for designers to generate content: in effect, to become designers and authors, not designers as authors. 
                While I am all for more authors, that was not quite the point I wanted to make.
             </p>
             <p>
                The problem is one of content. 
                The misconception is that without deep content, design is reduced to pure style, a bag of dubious tricks.
                In graphic-design circles, form-follows-function is reconfigured as form-follows-content.
                If content is the source of form, always preceding it and imbuing it with meaning, form without content (as if that were even possible) is some kind of empty shell.
             </p>
             <p>
                The apotheosis of this notion, repeated ad nauseum (still!), is Beatrice Warde’s famous Crystal Goblet metaphor, which asserts that design (the glass) should be a transparent vessel for content (the wine).
                Anyone who favored the ornate or the bejeweled was a knuckle-dragging oaf. Agitators on both sides of the ideological spectrum took up the debate: minimalists embraced it as a manifesto; maximalists decried it as aesthetic fascism.
                Neither camp questioned the basic, implicit premise: it’s all about the wine.
             </p>
             <p>
                This false dichotomy has circulated for so long that we have started to believe it ourselves. 
                It has become a central tenet of design education and the benchmark against which all design is judged. 
                We seem to accept the fact that developing content is more essential than shaping it, that good content is the measure of good design.
             </p>
             <p>
                Back when Paul Rand wrote “There is no such thing as bad content, only bad form,” I remember being intensely annoyed. I took it as an abdication of a designer’s responsibility to meaning. 
                Over time, I have come to read it differently: he was not defending hate speech or schlock or banality; he meant that the designer’s purview is to shape, not to write. 
                But that shaping itself is a profoundly affecting form. 
                (Perhaps this is the reason that modern designers—Rand, Munari, Leoni—always seem to end their careers designing children’s books. 
                The children’s book is the purest venue of the designer/author because the content is negligible and the evocative potential of the form unlimited.) 
             </p>
             <p>
                So what else is new? This seems to be a rather mundane point, but for some reason we don’t really believe it. We don’t believe shaping is enough. 
                So to bring design out from under the thumb of content we must go one step further and observe that treatment is, in fact, a kind of text itself, as complex and referential as any traditional understanding of content.
             </p>
             <p>
                A director can be the esteemed auteur of a film he didn’t write, score, edit or shoot. 
                What makes a Hitchcock film a Hitchcock film is not the story but a consistency of style, which winds intact through different technologies, plots, actors, and time periods like a substance of its own. 
                Every film is about filmmaking. 
                His great genius is that he is able to mold the form into his style in a genuinely unique and entertaining way. 
                The meaning of his work is not in the story but in the storytelling.
             </p>
             <p>
                Designers also trade in storytelling. 
                The elements we must master are not the content narratives but the devices of the telling: typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale, weight. 
                We speak through our assignment, literally between the lines.
             </p>
             <p>
                The span of graphic design is not a history of concepts but of forms. 
                Form has evolved dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continually revises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered. 
                Stellar examples of graphic design, design that changes the way we look at the world, are often found in service of the most mundane content: an ad for ink, cigarettes, sparkplugs or machinery. 
                Think of Piet Zwart’s catalogues for electrical cable; or the travel posters of Cassandre or Matter; or the New Wave work of Weingart, Greiman and Freidman; or the punk incitations of Jamie Reid, in which the manipulation of form has an essential, even transformative, meaning.
             </p>
             <p>
                At a 1962 conference at the Museum of Modern Art, conservative art critic Hilton Kramer denounced Pop Art as “indistinguishable from advertising art” because “Pop Art does not tell us what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization. 
                Its social effect is simply to reconcile us to a world of commodities, banalities and vulgarities.” 
                But perhaps the content of graphic design is exactly that: an evocation of “what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization,” with all its “commodities, banalities and vulgarities.” 
                How else can we discuss the content of a typeface or why the typography of a surfing magazine suddenly becomes relevant? Or how a series of made-up or ‘self-initiated’ posters—already a medium of dubious functionality— can end up on the wall of a major design museum? 
                Work must be saying something, which is different than being about something.
             </p>
             <p>
                Because the nature of the designed object is limited, individual objects are rarely substantial enough to contain fully rendered ideas. 
                Ideas develop over many projects, spanning years. Form itself is indexical. 
                We are intimately, physically connected to the work we produce, and it is inevitable that our work bears our stamp. 
                The choice of projects in each designer’s oeuvre lays out a map of interests and proclivities. 
                (I use the singular designer in the categorical sense, not the individual.) 
                The way those projects are parsed out, disassembled, reorganized and rendered reveals a philosophy, an aesthetic position, an argument and a critique.
             </p>
             <p>
                This deep connection to making also positions design in a modulating role between the user and the world. 
                By manipulating form, design reshapes that essential relationship. 
                Form is replaced by exchange. 
                The things we make negotiate a relationship over which we have a profound control.
             </p>
             <p>
                The trick is to find ways to speak through treatment, via a range of rhetorical devices— from the written to the visual to the operational—to make those proclamations as poignant as possible, and to return consistently to central ideas, to re-examine and re-express. 
                In this way we build a body of work, and from that body of work emerges a singular message, maybe even what it feels like to be living now. 
                As a popular film critic once wrote, “A movie is not what it is about, it’s how it is about it.” 
                Likewise, for us, our What is a How. 
                Our content is, perpetually, Design itself.

                <h2>Everyday Color Theory</h2>
                <h4>Cortney Cassidy / 2020</h4>
                <p>
                    The color you see is only the color you think you see. 
                    Your interpretation of light landing on a surface depends on your frame of reference and your frame of mind—both can be altered at the speed of light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m overwhelmed in a crowd I distract myself by looking for as many red-colored objects as I can. 
                    Red is not typically a calming color, especially if you’re staring at miles of brake lights in traffic, but it’s really easy for me to see. 
                    Red becomes the most dominant thing on my mind.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “Someone who speaks of the character of a colour is always thinking of just one particular way it is used.” — Ludwig Wittgenstein
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Humans have used red since the neolithic era, as seen in the prehistoric cave drawings; When developing languages, red is typically the color named first after black and white. 
                    It’s now used so frequently in advertising—because it attracts the most attention—that people have learned to ignore it. 
                    The ad industry has successfully made a highly visible color…invisible.

                    In grade school, I learned that yellow was the most soothing to color with when I brought the expensive markers I wasn’t allowed to use at home to school. 
                    I colored in a picture of Paddington wearing a raincoat well enough for my teacher to hang it on the wall for parent-teacher day. 
                    The comfort I experienced from quietly meeting the black lines with a high-contrast yellow, disappeared as I waited for my mother to find me out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In her piece commemorating a decade of internet colors, designer Laurel Schwulst reflects that “yellow tries to show you the way” in Google Maps. 
                    Artist Ian Whittlesea describes yellow as the easiest to mentally conjure in his seven breathing exercises to become invisible—inspired by the literature of Rosicrucianism, theosophy, and esoteric yoga. 
                    According to Whittlesea, Indigo is the most difficult color to generate and green can be the most difficult to keep stable.

                    Colors can be hard to see. 
                    To the chemist John Dalton, red, orange, yellow, and green all appeared the same. 
                    The rest of the color spectrum appeared as gradients of blue and purple. 
                    Dalton went on to write the first scientific paper on the subject of color blindness, “Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours” in 1798.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ludwig Wittgenstein — the Austrian philosopher who popularized the rabbit-duck illusion as a means of describing two different ways of seeing — wrote in Remarks on Colour, that “not every deviation from the norm must be a blindness.” 
                    He pointed out that the “normal” sighted and the color-blind do not have the same concept of color-blindness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with decreased ability to differentiate between hues experience color through a series of judgments. 
                    My colleague, for example, explained that for red, green, and brown to function for him, he has to consider their context. 
                    These judgments may be “wrong” when they need to be “right”; Like the order of a traffic light, the alternating red and green battery light on a vape pen, or the order of a color legend matching the clockwise color placement in a pie chart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If one says ‘red’ and there are fifty people listening, it can be expected that there will be fifty reds in their minds,” wrote the artist and educator Josef Albers. 
                    We see fifty different reds because we each perceive and experience color differently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The artist Wassily Kandinsky could practically hear and taste color because of his synesthesia. 
                    To him yellow was a trumpet’s C note, black was the end of things, “blue is cold, red is a square, and green is a feeling,” as summarized by the painter Amy Sillman who called Kandinsky’s philosophy a kind of color astrology in her essay “Drug, Poison, Remedy, Talisman, Cosmetic, Intoxicant.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1810, writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe decided that an equilateral triangle was the most effective form for his ideas on the psychological effect of colors. 
                    This new way of organizing color came about a hundred years after Sir Isaac Newton first arranged colors on a disk, to create an early form of the color wheel. 
                    The triangle served Goethe as a modular system of desirable and dissonant color relationships that evoked vibes like serious, mighty, serene, and melancholic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colors can change depending on the nature of surfaces, like the atmospheric oxidation of the Statue of Liberty’s plating from shiny copper to verdigris (a bluish-green patina). 
                    In 1906, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed a proposal from the United States Congress to restore the statue, concluding that the patina protecting the underlying metal from corrosion “softened the outlines, and made it beautiful.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can see those softened outlines because light helps us discern forms. 
                    I find Vantablack—one of the darkest known substances, absorbing 99.96% of visible light—unsettling. 
                    As Kassia St Clair explains in The Secret Lives of Color, “black is an expression of light, in this case, it’s absence.” 
                    My eyes hunt for the surface, and Vantablack leaves nothing to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    White surfaces reflect and scatter visible light, and according to Wittgenstein “very few people have seen pure white.” 
                    In the essay “In Praise of Shadows” on traditional Japanese aesthetics, Jun’ichirō Tanizaki wrote that “western paper turns away light, while [Japanese] paper seems to take it in, to envelope it gently, like the soft surface of a first snowfall.” 
                    If you take a piece of computer paper, that you know is white in its normal surroundings, and place it next to snow, the paper may appear grey. 
                    A white can be light grey in poor lighting or a light grey in good lighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or a dress can look black and blue under yellow light and white and gold in blue light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In full sunlight, the petals of a red flower appear bright red against duller green leaves. 
                    At dusk, the red flowers become darker while blue flowers appear brighter than they did in full daylight. 
                    This effect is called the Purkinje shift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Albers based his career on studying these kinds of shifts in color. 
                    In his book Interaction of Color, first published in 1963, he created color theory exercises that could make “colors lie”—as Tamara Shopsin put it in her essay “Homage to an Homage of an Homage.” 
                    By itself, a color appears dominant, but when placed next to an even stronger hue, we can see its more diminished true nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sixty years before Interaction of Color, the artist and historian Emily Noyes Vanderpoel published color studies in her forgotten book, Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color. 
                    Her work predicted trends that wouldn’t occur for several decades, like the concentric square format of Albers’s Homage to the Square.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In color therapy, also known as chromotherapy, shifts in color can change minds. Each color is believed to have healing energies that can affect the body, like red for passion, green for harmony, and violet for intuition. 
                    One method for administering chromotherapy includes eating foods of a specific color. The artist Sophie Calle does this in her series The Chromatic Diet. 
                    Inspired by Paul Auster’s Leviathan, in which a character inspired by Sophie Calle herself restricts her diet to foods of a single color on certain days, Calle recreates and photographs each meal in the book as an act to bring herself and the fictional character closer together.

                    An inventor in Arkansas advertised Vision-Dieter, his special two-color tinted glasses that deter shoppers from buying brightly-colored food packages. 
                    He boasted that “you won’t believe your eyes” and that the combination of a blue and brown tint was a “secret European color technology.” 
                    But the product didn’t work and the FDA destroyed most of the glasses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the computer, the physical production of pigments limited our access to color. 
                    Naturally occurring, finely ground minerals mixed with toxic solvents — or the urine of cows fed mango leaves — were expensive. 
                    Ultramarine was the most expensive blue used by Renaissance painters and remained available only to the rich, or those backed by wealthy benefactors, until the invention of a synthetic version in 1826.

                    In “On Color,” Sillman notes that most oil painters can tell the difference between colors from their weight alone, but that also means we’re “somewhat doomed to the palette provided by manufacturers.” 
                    Even our ready-made digital palettes are predetermined for us by the choices of both software and hardware manufacturers. 
                    (Or whoever we borrow from when using the eyedropper tool.)

                    Our perceptions of people or objects in photographs change dramatically from black and white to color. 
                    If I see myself in a black and white photo, I am far less critical about my polychromatic flaws because they’re filtered out. 
                    And if I see a colorized photograph of a historical figure or event, I’m surprised by how real they seem.

                    With the invention of movable type, the colorful heraldic language for coats of arms, was transferred into a one-color hatching system for books, wax seals, and coins. 
                    The graphic design duo Dexter Sinister tested the transference of color data to one-color hatching by converting a László Moholy-Nagy panel that he originally “painted” over the phone with a manufacturer.

                    In the Farnsworth-Munsell test, in which a subject has to arrange 100 hues on a continuous gradation scale, less than sixteen percent achieve a perfect score. 
                    According to Johannes Itten, one of Albers’s instructors at the Weimar Bauhaus, distinguishing the many shades of a color depends on the sensitivity of the eye and “the response threshold of the observer.” 
                    In English, we only use about thirty names for colors in daily vocabulary, and only a “trained artist can discriminate and name a great many hues,” wrote Umberto Eco in “The Colors We See.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Albers believed that developing a sensitive eye for color took practice, but it doesn’t come without a bit of work: Illustrator Tamara Shopsin writes that Albers’s exercises “were hard and time-consuming”; Sillman compared his Interaction of Color to notes from a test kitchen: “To do his exercises, you first have to gather color swatches like ingredients, splice and dice them, layer them and shift them around to test them out on your eyeballs.”

                    “When one becomes infatuated with the seven [spectral] colors, the mind is easily distracted,” wrote Masanoba Fukuoka, in his manifesto One-Straw Revolution. 
                    One of the most important organic farmers of the twentieth century, Fukuoka believed that viewing the colors of the world with “no-mind” — a state that recognizes the insufficiency of intellectual knowledge — helps one see the color of the colorless as color.

                    A flat gray surface can come to life through its small modulations of shading, which requires a visual sensitivity to tonal differences. 
                    The act of arranging the subtle differences is like arranging lengths of sticks or consecutive numbers, according to Wittgenstein, who once asked, “To what extent can we compare black and white to yellow, red, and blue?”

                    To use his own words in response, “Colors are the children of light, and light is their mother.” 
                    Notably, Vanderpoel also called color “the music of light.” 
                    Black and white, yellow, red, and blue preserve their relationship with light through the scales of tones between their lightest and darkest. 
                    The continuous scale does not change in saturation, but changes in brilliance. 
                    As all colors we can and cannot see differ depending on their surface, surrounding, and our state of mind—they will always in some way share their brilliance.

             <h3>Towards a complex simplicity</h3>
             <h4>Andrew Blauvelt, Daniel Eatock, Dave Eggers / 2000</h4>
                 <p>
                    What defines contemporary graphic design today? 
                    The shelves of your local bookshop provide at least one answer. 
                    Most books published on the so-called avant-garde of contemporary design represent the institutionalisation of graphic experimentation, only confirming that the radical signs surrounding design in the late 1980s and early 1990s have become thoroughly predictable. 
                    Not only has this kind of work become a marketable aesthetic niche, but it is perpetuated by educational institutions that dutifully churn out the latest incremental variations in formulaic fashion, fuelled by the twin myths of expressionism and stylistic pluralism.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    In his analysis of the 1980s art scene, the critic Hal Foster describes at least two conditions that identify a state of pluralism: a proliferation of accepted styles in the marketplace and a profusion of educational programmes that together constitute a new academy. 
                    I believe that graphic design operates under similar conditions today. 
                    The problem with pluralism is that styles become relative options, not critical choices. 
                    Although pluralism ensures many styles from which to choose, we lose any sense of critical alternatives because, as Foster states, “tolerance and acceptance doesn’t threaten the status quo”. 
                    Instead we have incremental or, in the parlance of 1990s economics, “managed” change. 
                    Just as the last round of “radical” graphics entered the profession in the late 1980s, many critics predicted an immediate opposite reaction, not understanding perhaps the speed and depth of assimilation such work would engender.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    The prevailing notion of what defines contemporary graphic design took hold early in the 1990s – variously and problematically referred to as Deconstructivism, grunge graphics, or simply, the “cult of the ugly”. 
                    In antithetical fashion, some critics foresaw an inevitable reaction to the trend by predicting a return to more minimal or reductive approaches. 
                    Emigre magazine devoted an issue to the subject (“Starting from Zero”) as early as 1991, in which the idea of reduction was taken to mean a return to the primal, and in 1995 Carel Kuitenbrouwer presciently saw the turn in contemporary Dutch design away from its baroque excesses and towards a “new sobriety” (Eye no. 17 vol. 5). 
                    The prophecies continue with the recent publication of Less Is More, by Steven Heller and Anne Fink, a collection of contemporary design defined by familiar yet retrograde notions of simplicity. 
                    In the wake of these predictions has the cult of complexity given way to an ethos of simplicity?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    At the beginning of the decade it seemed as if there was an ever-expanding universe of graphic possibilities, yet now it feels as if we have reached the limit. 
                    Is there no way forward when everything seems possible? In this infinity of possibilities, we may arrive at zero. 
                    But to begin again does not mean returning to the “good old days” of clarity, legibility and objectivity. 
                    Starting from zero does not mean that contemporary design arrives free of the past.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    There are signs of different forms of design taking hold, projects and solutions that embrace reductive not additive working methods, explicit rather than implicit structures of organisation, a preference for the literal over the ambiguous, and where the ordinary and the quotidian, not the exoticised subcultures of the vernacular, are sources of inspiration. 
                    At their best such projects are a critical encounter with problems of representation, both verbal and visual, rather than the next round of stylistic permutations. 
                    This shift away from the simply complex and towards a complex simplicity is a condition that I would like to read against many of the most celebrated characteristics of design produced in the 1990s.
                 </p>
                 <em>A complex simplicity</em>
                 <p>
                    In the realm of the simply complex, fragmentation is preferred as the viewer assembles various bits of text and image to form an aggregate message. 
                    Such work tends to treat language as a free-floating talisman, isolated words drifting across the page in search of meaning. 
                    By contrast a complex simplicity relies on enumeration and explication, a series of digressions and elaborations linked in the flow of language. 
                    What seems trivial and tangential becomes essential – like so many bits and pieces of data in the detritus of the information age. 
                    This abundance of information is employed to dramatic and occasionally humorous effect. 
                    Structure becomes paramount in order to handle large quantities of texts and images: a penchant for charts, diagrams and maps prevails. 
                    But in the most interesting work what appears to be good old information design reveals, upon closer examination, something more subjective – a kind of over-rationalised explication – that undermines its historical associations of neutrality and objectivity.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    The diagrammatic and the eccentric converge in Timothy McSweeney’s, a literary journal in which words reign supreme. 
                    This is confirmed by the admonishment on the cover of issue two: “If words are to be used as design elements then let designers write them.” 
                    Prone to confabulation, this small, book-like journal is set in only one typeface, Garamond, about which is provided a five-page pseudo-colophon. 
                    McSweeney’s is typically bereft of imagery, especially photography, preferring small line illustrations and the occasional diagram or dingbat. 
                    Its well crafted covers evoke Victorian typographic guises with elaborate extended prose and marginalia, while intricate charts structure the contents of each issue in much the way that nineteenth-century physiognomy charts tried to map human nature. 
                    McSweeney’s relies on verbal explication and finds a visual corollary in the diagram. The contents of issue two, for example, are represented by the number of words per article and approximate reading time, and by a pie chart that categorises the offerings by percentage, for example, “Stories that want you to be happy: 19%.” 
                    Carefully ordered, but abhorrent of white space, it leaves no place unused. Witness, from the third issue cover, messages such as “This area was blank for the longest time” or “Nothing need happen here”, or an article printed on the spine. 
                    For McSweeney’s the modernist principle of “activated” white space seems empty, both wasteful and useless, because every place is a seen as a potential space to hold meaning.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    It is also possible for the form to structure itself. 
                    For example, various bits of data taken together form a powerful gestalt in Jeremy Coysten’s poster series on aeroplane crashes and traffic accidents. 
                    Coolly rendered as scatterplots, Coysten’s Civil Airline Disasters 1950-1998 fixes the location and death toll of 607 aviation tragedies, their resulting dispersal pattern forming an image of the world. Coysten’s poster was prompted by his own near-miss incident aboard a flight to Australia. 
                    A second poster in the series documents road accidents in the uk over one week. 
                    In both instances the rational forms of information design have been employed to register the seemingly irrational loss of life. 
                    The calculated nature of the statistics contrasts with random events or accidents. 
                    The posters are produced for sale and are not commissioned for public safety campaigns. 
                    In this way information becomes both a product and a surrogate form of experience.
                 </p>
                 <em>Sublimating expression</em>
                 <p>
                    While the overt intervention of the designer figured prominently as a signifier of self-expression, one can detect the suspension of many of the designer’s more subjective decision-making tasks. 
                    Like forms of conceptual art, the preferred mode is more detached, relying on systematic approaches to produce solutions. 
                    Sol LeWitt once proclaimed that “the idea is the machine that makes the art”. 
                    The systematic nature of a predetermined process generates its form, and in this way it is the process itself that becomes the concept. 
                    Although the designer has not been entirely removed, what is foregrounded is the visible traces of the process. 
                    Unlike some Modernist attempts at abandoning subjectivity in favour of machine-like rationality, certain projects provide a framework for future actions outside the usual control of the designer and are often completed by the viewer.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    An example of such participatory, rather than prescriptive, design is a poster by Paul Elliman for a conference on the work of the French writer Lautréamont (see Eye no. 25 vol. 7, page 31). 
                    White boxes have been inserted between the words “image”, “Maldoror” and “text”, for conference participants to complete, alter or negate. 
                    This simple gesture allows the project to generate a multitude of responses, which as an action echoes the nature of the event’s interpretive agenda. 
                    In a similar but more extreme vein, Daniel Eatock’s utilitarian poster project, essentially a generic form silk-screened on newsprint paper, methodically guides the user through the steps of creating their own advertisement, and includes blanks to insert relevant information, such as titles of events, images, persons to contact, etc. 
                    In this instance the work is wholly dependent on viewer response, the absence of which denies the piece its essential content.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Anne Burdick’s design for Wörterbuch der Redensarten, a dictionary of idioms, demonstrates an intricate form of complexity that weaves together various texts. 
                    Gathered from the work of Karl Krauss’s Die Fackel, a literary journal published between 1899 and 1936, Burdick worked with a group of researchers in Vienna to generate a series of design directions for the subsequent layout of 1,056 pages. 
                    The aim of the project is interpretative, not exhaustive, therefore the body of the text comprises only 144 expressions used by Krauss in Die Fackel. 
                    The purpose of this dictionary is to register the nuances of Krauss’s concepts and expressions. 
                    Representing a decidedly postmodern “tissue of quotations”, Burdick has structured the pages so that the central column of text includes excerpts from Krauss’s writings, while the left column contains citations and cross-references, and the right column contains texts that perform “interpretative actions” on the main passage. 
                    Because Krauss often used typography and imagery semantically in his writings, the central column frequently contains images and passages of text lifted directly from the original. 
                    Burdick acknowledges that conventional assumptions of design authorship were hampered by both the scope of the project and the barrier of a foreign language. 
                    Relying instead on a series of instructions, Burdick’s solution nevertheless bears the traces of the designer’s close attention to the details that would allow the project to realise its most appropriate polyphonic form.

                    Simple complexity demands typographic experimentation, highly articulated structures and eccentric typefaces. By contrast, a complex simplicity revels in the spartan vocabulary of what might be called “vanilla typography”, where typography has been reduced to a near-zero degree of expression – neither pretty nor eccentric, but quite plain. 
                    This is an inverted world where the ordinary stands out from the crowd as a distinctive gesture. 
                    By comparison, yesteryear’s shaped paragraph blocks and micromanaged type treatments look like fussy affectations, so many histrionics in the passion play of design. 
                    This change in typographies signals not only a shift in fashion, but also helps expose the expressionistic fallacy behind much 1990s design.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Expressionism denies its existence as a language, and thus a style, in order to preserve a sense of immediacy, a supposedly unmediated or direct connection to individual desire and the unconscious. 
                    Indeed, in most forms of contemporary design, expressionism has become synonymous with individuality. 
                    While modern typography in the 1960s and 1970s could be easily linked with the increasing rationality of the then-emerging industrial technocracy, today’s similar but simpler typography is aligned with the cultural sectors of fashion and art. 
                    This simplified approach to typography, while relatively common to many culture magazines, is most often employed in conjunction with the nouveau realist photography of the quotidian.
                 </p>
                 <em>Picturing the everyday</em>
                 <p>
                    One of the more influential publications in this genre is Paris-based Purple, which surveys the worlds of art, fashion, fiction, prose and interiors. 
                    Segregating the verbal (prose, fiction) from the visual (art, fashion, interiors), Purple’s preferred image is the snapshot, the most immediate form of photographic address. Uncomplicated, unstudied, and frequently unstaged, the snapshot negates the conditions of professional, commercial photography, with its requisite need for elaborate lighting set-ups, make-up, styling and retouching. 
                    While images have undergone extensive digital manipulation in the past decade, the recent resurgence of the snapshot makes one wonder whether this form of representation is a critical alternative or simply a fashionable one. 
                    The extensive presence of fashion advertising that mimics this look in the pages of Purple suggests the latter.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    In this image world, life is collected in pictures documenting the everyday in the face of a highly mediated, spectacularised existence. 
                    The moment preserved by the snapshot is valued because it signifies “realness”. 
                    This theme appears in cultiver notre jardin, by Jan van Toorn. Using a structure of perforated and folded pages, Van Toorn alternates between colour and black and white images – pictures taken mainly by him – of people, friends and places around the world. 
                    Interspersed through the book are quotations about social reality, mediated experience and notions of public and private space, including a quote by social critic Mike Davis, who argues for a re-examination of nineteenth-century realism and its relationship to everyday life. 
                    Van Toorn extols us to “cultivate our own garden”, by carving out a space in the public sphere in what have become expanding corporate and institutional fields.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Rather than striving to record moments of realness as it happens, other designers prefer a much more mediated approach to representation. 
                    Eschewing visual ambiguity, including the clichéd stylistic affectations of blurriness, the preferred mode of pictorial represent-ation is documentary realness – not an attempt at capturing the authentic, but a much more studied trope that signifies the real but does not try to stand in for it. 
                    This strategy is evinced in Jop van Bennekom’s self-initiated project, re-, a magazine about everyday life. 
                    In an issue devoted to sex, the cover models (a man and a woman) appear fresh from a sexual encounter – replete with small beads of perspiration on their faces. 
                    Inside, the clichés of sex are distributed accordingly – sexual innuendo and phallicism, photos of stained mattresses and bits of blacked-out (“censored”) texts. 
                    Importantly, the subjects of re- are ordinary people, not celebrities.
                    The texts remain first-person accounts, either testimonials, diaristic thoughts, or confessions.
                 </p>
                 <em>The ordinary made extraordinary</em>
                 <p>
                    With the reconsideration of the ordinary and everyday within graphic design, one may ask whether we are witnessing the end of what was once referred to as “the society of the spectacle”. 
                    It is more likely that with today’s campaigns for global branding – the process that transforms the ordinary into the memorable – we long for the less-mediated experiences found in the routines of daily life. 
                    Perhaps we can’t recognise the spectacle because it exists all around us.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    After attending America: Cult and Culture, last year’s AIGA [American Institute of Graphic Arts] conference in Las Vegas (Reviews, Eye no. 34 vol. 9), it seemed all too easy to leave the spectacle behind as my plane departed. Watching television at home, a group of rather ordinary young men and women dressed casually but alike were singing along to an old Madonna tune. 
                    The minimal white stage set and the uninflected karaoke ushered in the autumn season of clothing for The Gap and I found myself transfixed: ordinary clothes worn by average people elevated to a new aesthetic. 
                    At that moment it was difficult, but not impossible, to remember that the truly ordinary lies in opposition to the brand. 
                    I was reminded of the architect Deborah Berke’s warning, in writing about the transformation of the landscape from banal to branded: “To confuse ubiquitous logos with generic identity [is] to mistake successful marketing for ‘popular’ culture.” 
                    At the eclipse of the society of the spectacle, the ordinary is made extraordinary and the trivial and mundane become memorable.
